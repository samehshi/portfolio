This project focuses on building predictive models for corporate bankruptcy using financial data from Polish companies. The objective is to predict corporate bankruptcy.

The notebook covers the following key aspects:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Initial steps involve loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure, distributions, and potential issues.

2.  **Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and data scaling.

3.  **Feature Engineering:** May involve creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.

4.  **Model Selection:** Explores various machine learning models suitable for classification tasks (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, SVMs).

5.  **Training and Evaluation:** Trains the selected models on the preprocessed data and evaluates their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC), often considering the imbalanced nature of bankruptcy datasets.

6.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes model parameters to achieve better performance.

7.  **Insights:** Aims to provide insights into the factors contributing to corporate bankruptcy and the effectiveness of different predictive models.

In essence, it's a comprehensive machine learning project demonstrating the process of building and evaluating bankruptcy prediction models using real-world financial data.
