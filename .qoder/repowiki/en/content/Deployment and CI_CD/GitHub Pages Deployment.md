## Introduction
This document provides comprehensive guidance for deploying the portfolio to GitHub Pages using the gh-pages package and npm run deploy script. It covers the complete deployment lifecycle, from configuration to verification, including the predeploy process, build configuration, and deployment workflow. The documentation includes step-by-step instructions from the DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md, verification procedures from DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md, and solutions for common deployment issues.

## Deployment Configuration

### Package.json Configuration
The deployment process is configured in package.json with specific scripts and settings that enable GitHub Pages deployment. The configuration includes the homepage URL, repository information, and deployment scripts that orchestrate the build and deployment process.

**Section sources**
- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L81)

### Homepage and Repository Settings
The package.json file contains critical configuration for GitHub Pages deployment, including the homepage URL and repository information. The homepage field must be set to the correct GitHub Pages URL format to ensure proper routing and asset loading.

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://samehshi.github.io/portfolio",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/samehshi/portfolio.git"
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that all assets are correctly referenced from the GitHub Pages domain and that the repository is properly identified for deployment purposes.

### Deployment Scripts
The deployment process is automated through npm scripts defined in package.json. These scripts handle the build process and deployment to the gh-pages branch using the gh-pages package.

```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "build": "node fetch.js && react-scripts build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -b gh-pages -d build"
}
```

The predeploy script automatically triggers the build process before deployment, ensuring that the latest version of the application is deployed. The deploy script uses the gh-pages command to push the contents of the build directory to the gh-pages branch.

- [package.json](file://package.json#L45-L48)

## Deployment Process

### Predeploy Lifecycle
The deployment process begins with the predeploy lifecycle script, which automatically executes the build command before deployment. This ensures that the most recent version of the application is compiled and ready for deployment.

The build process includes:
- Running the fetch.js script to gather dynamic data
- Compiling React components and assets
- Optimizing and minifying code for production
- Generating the build directory with all necessary files

This automated predeploy step eliminates the need for manual build execution and ensures consistency between development and production environments.

### Deployment Steps
The deployment process follows a structured sequence of steps as outlined in the DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md file.

### 1. Push Code to GitHub
Before deployment, ensure all changes are pushed to the main branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Portfolio setup complete - ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Execute Deployment Script
Run the npm deploy script to build and deploy the application:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command executes the predeploy script (which runs the build), then deploys the contents of the build directory to the gh-pages branch using the gh-pages package.

### 3. Configure GitHub Pages
In the GitHub repository settings, navigate to Pages and configure the deployment source:
1. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
2. Select the gh-pages branch
3. Save the settings

The site will be available at the URL specified in the homepage field of package.json.

## Verification and Success Criteria

### Immediate Verification
After deployment, verify the successful deployment by checking the following criteria from DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md:

- [ ] Site loads at https://samehshi.github.io/portfolio/
- [ ] All navigation links function correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness is maintained
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle works properly
- [ ] GA4 analytics are tracking real-time visitors

### Analytics Verification
The deployment includes enterprise-level Google Analytics 4 implementation with comprehensive event tracking. Verify analytics by:

1. Opening the GA4 dashboard and navigating to Reports > Realtime
2. Visiting the deployed site in another tab
3. Confirming real-time visitor tracking appears
4. Testing custom events (scroll sections, click social links)

The analytics implementation tracks 20+ custom events including section views, project interactions, social media clicks, resume downloads, and theme changes.

### SEO and Social Validation
Verify SEO and social sharing functionality using the following tools:

### Social Media Sharing Tests
- **Facebook/LinkedIn**: Use Facebook Debugger to verify Open Graph data
- **Twitter**: Use Twitter Card Validator to confirm card preview
- **Search Engines**: Use Google Rich Results Test to verify structured data

### Search Engine Verification
- Check sitemap.xml at https://samehshi.github.io/portfolio/sitemap.xml
- Verify robots.txt at https://samehshi.github.io/portfolio/robots.txt
- Monitor Google Search Console for indexing status

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Site Not Loading
If the site is not loading after deployment, check the following:

**Common Causes:**
- GitHub Actions workflow failed
- Incorrect homepage URL in package.json
- Missing gh-pages branch
- Propagation delays (allow 5-10 minutes)

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow progress and errors
2. Verify Pages settings in repository
3. Confirm the homepage field in package.json matches the GitHub Pages URL
4. Allow additional time for DNS propagation

### Build Failures
Build failures can occur due to various issues in the codebase or configuration.

**Common Causes:**
- Missing image assets referenced in portfolio.js
- Invalid imports or syntax errors
- Environment variable configuration issues
- fetch.js script failures

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check GitHub Actions workflow logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all image paths in src/portfolio.js are correct
3. Ensure environment variables are properly configured
4. Test the build process locally with npm run build

### GitHub Data Integration Issues
When GitHub data is not showing, verify the following configuration:

**Required Settings:**
- REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set
- Token has appropriate permissions (public_repo, read:user)
- USE_GITHUB_DATA=true in build environment
- GITHUB_USERNAME is correctly configured

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with required permissions
2. Add the token to repository secrets as GITHUB_TOKEN
3. Update environment variables and rebuild
